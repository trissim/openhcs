🚧 **Under Construction** 🚧
----------------------------

The user guide is currently being rewritten to reflect the latest OpenHCS architecture and workflows.

**For immediate help, use these resources**:

📁 **Complete Working Example**: `openhcs/debug/example_export.py <https://github.com/trissim/toolong/blob/openhcs/openhcs/debug/example_export.py>`_

This production script demonstrates every major OpenHCS feature with real parameters and working code.

📚 **Current Documentation**:

- :doc:`../guides/complete_examples` - Complete examples and code patterns
- :doc:`../api/index` - API reference with working examples  
- :doc:`../concepts/index` - Core concepts and architecture
- :doc:`../getting_started/getting_started` - Basic installation and setup

**What's Coming**:

- **TUI Workflow Guide** - Complete tutorial for the interactive interface
- **Script Generation Guide** - How OpenHCS generates self-contained scripts
- **Integration Patterns** - Real-world usage examples and best practices
- **Performance Optimization** - GPU acceleration and large dataset handling
- **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues and debugging approaches

**Current Status**:

The existing user guide sections contain outdated references and examples. We're rewriting them to match the current OpenHCS architecture and provide accurate, practical guidance.

**Need Help Now?**

1. **Start with the example script** - `openhcs/debug/example_export.py`
2. **Check the API documentation** - All examples are tested and working
3. **Review the concepts** - Core architecture explanations are accurate
4. **Ask questions** - The development team is responsive to user needs

**Timeline**:

- **Phase 1**: Complete example integration ✅ **Done**
- **Phase 2**: TUI workflow documentation 🚧 **In Progress**  
- **Phase 3**: Practical integration examples 📋 **Planned**
- **Phase 4**: Performance and troubleshooting guides 📋 **Planned**
