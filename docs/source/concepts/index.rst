==========================
Core Concepts
==========================

This section provides a comprehensive overview of OpenHCS's core concepts and architecture. These pages serve as a context primer for both scientists with domain knowledge and developers with CS backgrounds, focusing on building intuition about why OpenHCS exists and what it enables.

**Getting Started**: If you're new to OpenHCS, we recommend reading these pages in order. Each concept builds on the previous ones to give you a complete understanding of the system.

**Target Audience**: These pages are designed for both non-CS scientists needing to understand OpenHCS fundamentals and developers without domain knowledge who need scientific context.
