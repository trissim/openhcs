Research Impact and Real-World Deployment
=========================================

Overview
--------

OpenHCS isn’t just another academic tool - it’s actively solving real
research problems in neuroscience with datasets that break traditional
tools. This document outlines the real-world research impact, production
deployment characteristics, and scientific contributions of OpenHCS.

Research Applications
--------------------

The Reality of Scientific Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most academic software suffers from the “demo dataset problem”:

.. code:: python

   # Typical academic tool limitations:
   ❌ Works on 10MB demo datasets
   ❌ Crashes on real-world data (100GB+)
   ❌ Single-user, single-machine design
   ❌ Proof-of-concept code quality
   ❌ No production deployment support
   ❌ Format-specific, vendor lock-in
   ❌ Maintenance-free assumptions

OpenHCS was designed for production research environments.

Massive Dataset Handling
------------------------

Real-World Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   # High-content screening dataset characteristics:
   Dataset Scale:
   ├── Size: 100GB+ per experimental plate
   ├── Images: 50,000+ individual TIFF files per experiment
   ├── Wells: 384-well plates with 9 fields per well (3,456 positions)
   ├── Channels: 4-6 fluorescent channels per field
